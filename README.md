# Database Course Project - A Social Media

All the codes for UI and SQL commands are in the db.py file; it's a bit messy, as I only had one night to write it all :D.
This project's main aim was to create database for a social media, suitable for all types of action possible in an Instagram-like social media.
I don't think the UI be usable to anyone! However, for each possible action, a separate function is created with the required SQL commands in it, which can be useful.
